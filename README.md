# Simple-Minesweeper
Minesweeper project I used as part of my proposal to my now wife

Initially this started out as a simple, fun project to work on in my free time, since I had missed coding simple little games in Java from my first year of college.

Soon after starting, I realized it would be a perfect way to surprise my then girlfriend with a marriage proposal, something she was expecting, but not at all like this.

The game was completed to simple form, and not exactly polished, but I just wanted to get the job done since I was nervous. There are plenty of things that weren't implemented from when I first had the idea, but I decided to sort of preserve the program how it was on the night she said yes.
